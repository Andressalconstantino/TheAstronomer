<span id="title">Webb Telescope</span>

<span id="text">James Webb Telescope is a telescope developed by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), aiming to be a powerful space observatory that will answer important question about the universe.<br>
According to the website "Science Alert":<br>
"The telescope's centerpiece is its enormous primary mirror, a concave structure 21.5 feet (6.5 meters) wide and made up of 18 smaller hexagonal mirrors. They're made from beryllium coated with gold, optimized for reflecting infrared light from the far reaches of the universe.<br>
The telescope will be placed in orbit about a million miles from Earth, roughly four times the distance of our planet from the Moon... Webb will orbit the Sun and will remain directly behind Earth, from the point of view of the Sun, allowing it to remain on our planet's night side. Webb's sunshield will always be between the mirror and our star.<br>
Astronomers began debating the telescope that should succeed Hubble in the 1990s, with Webb's construction beginning in 2004.<br>
Launch has been pushed back several times, initially penciled for 2007, then 2018...mainly because of the complexities associated with development.<br>
The observatory is the result of an immense international collaboration and integrates Canadian and European instruments.<br>
More than 10,000 people worked on the project, with the budget eventually snowballing to around $10 billion."
