<span id="title">Asteroid set to fly-by earth</span>

<span id="text">The asteroid (7482) 1994 PC1 which is 3 times the Empire State Building's size is set to fly-by earth on january 18 at a distance of around 1.98 million km away.<br>
According to the website "9News":<br>
"If an asteroid over 140 metres in diameter impacted Earth, it would release an amount of energy at least a thousand times greater than the first atomic bomb, research from the Davidson Institute of Science found.
But to wipe out civilisation, one would have to be much bigger.<br>
Planetary scientist at the University of Queensland Trevor Ireland previously told 9news.com.au civilisation-ending asteroids would have to measure more than a kilometre in diameter, at least, to cause an "extinction-level" event.<br>
The asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs and formed the Chicxulub crater in Mexico is estimated to have been around 9.6 kilometres in diameter.<br>
"There's about a million one kilometre asteroids in the asteroid belt," Professor Ireland said.
"The likelihood of one of those suddenly meandering down to Earth is very remote."<br>
NASA has previously stated Earth will not be at risk from a PHO for more than 100 year, when Asteroid Bennu completes a fly-by."<br><br>
